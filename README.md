# Food_Vision_Big

Welcome to "Food Vision Big™," where we're taking image classification to the next level. 

In this project, we leverage the entire Food101 dataset, TensorFlow Datasets, and advanced techniques to build a model that aims to beat the DeepFood paper's top-1 accuracy of 77.4%. 
Our journey includes data handling, efficient training, model building, fine-tuning, and visualization of results. 
Let's explore the world of "Food Vision Big™". 

Enjoy the ride! 🍔👁
